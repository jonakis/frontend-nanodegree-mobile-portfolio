        I worked as a project based developer for 3 months in H2.During my stay, I was able to create an automation tool
        using
        Microsoft Excel VBA. The tool's purpose was to reduce the time spent with their report generation. Before the
        app was created, it usually takes a week or two to finished all reports, the app was able to reduce this down to
        five to fifteen minutes. But due to the distance of my home to my workplace and my salary does not suffice all
        my
        fairs and bills and necessities, I decided to look for new job.

        <p> I was a techinal staff member in Redcore IT Solutions for a year and 6 months. During my stay, I
          did web and desktop application development, sometimes I do technical support. The place is very stress free.
          I met a lot of very very kind people. Though I was enjoying working in the place, I left because I thought I
          need to do more studying. But I ended up freelancing and I thought its better for the time being so I can take
          rest. <br> Now I do online job. </p>
